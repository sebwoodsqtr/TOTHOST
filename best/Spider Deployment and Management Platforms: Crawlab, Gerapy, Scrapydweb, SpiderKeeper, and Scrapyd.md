```bash
docker pull tikazyq/crawlab:latest
docker-compose up
```
Ensure you configure the `docker-compose.yml` file based on the official documentation.

#### Step 2: Features and Usage
1. **Node Management:** Nodes (servers) handle spider execution and API management.
   - View node lists and topology.
2. **Spider Management:** Manage spiders, deploy them, and track data collection.
3. **Task Management:** Tasks represent specific data collection events linked to spiders. Tasks include scheduling and result tracking.
4. **Missing Features:** Lacks error monitoring, configurable spiders, and centralized log collection.
