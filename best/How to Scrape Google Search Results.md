# How to Scrape Google Search Results

## Introduction

This guide explores two effective methods to scrape Google search results: building your own web scraper and using a SERP API. With minor adjustments, you can replicate these methods to extract SERP data efficiently. Let's dive in!

## Limitations of Google Search API

While Google offers an official Search API, it has notable drawbacks:

- **Limited Scope:** Primarily designed for searching within a specific website or group of sites.
- **Restricted Data:** Provides significantly less information compared to web scraping.
- **Expensive:** Costs $5 for 1,000 requests, with daily limits on usage.

Given these limitations, web scraping is often a better choice for extracting SERP data.

## Method 1: Building a Basic Web Scraper

This method involves creating a scraper to extract data such as titles, descriptions, and URLs from Google search results. The scraper downloads the HTML of the search page, parses the results, and saves the data in JSON format.

### Required Modules
We need the following Python modules:
```python
import json
from urllib.parse import urlencode
import requests
from lxml import etree
```

### Step 1: Define the Query
Set up the parameters for the Google search query and encode the URL to avoid issues with special characters like spaces:
```python
payload = {
    'q': 'car insurance',  # Search query
    'uule': 'w+CAIQICIHR2VybWFueQ',  # Location (optional)
}
params = urlencode(payload)
url = f'https://www.google.com/search?{params}'
```

### Step 2: Send an HTTP Request
Send a GET request to fetch the HTML response:
```python
response = requests.get(url)
```

### Step 3: Parse the HTML
Convert the HTML into an XML tree for easier data extraction:
```python
parser = etree.HTMLParser()
tree = etree.fromstring(response.text, parser)
```

### Step 4: Extract Data
Use XPath to locate and extract relevant elements:
```python
results = []
result_elements = tree.xpath(
    './/div[contains(@class, "ZINbbc") and not(@style="display:none")]'
)

for element in result_elements:
    results.append({
        'url': element.xpath('.//a/@href')[0],
        'title': element.xpath('.//h3//text()')[0],
        'description': element.xpath('.//div[contains(@class, "BNeawe")]//text()')[-1],
    })
```

### Step 5: Save Data to JSON
Write the parsed data into a JSON file:
```python
with open('parsed_results.json', 'w+') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

## Advanced Features for Scaling

### Adding User Agents
Randomize user agents to mimic real users and avoid detection:
```python
headers = {
    'User-Agent': random.choice([
        'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.131 Safari/537.36',
        'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0',
    ])
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

### Pagination
Add support for multiple pages by including a `start` parameter:
```python
for page in range(0, pages * 10, 10):
    payload['start'] = page
    params = urlencode(payload)
    url = f'https://www.google.com/search?{params}'
```

### Using Proxies
Rotate proxies to prevent IP bans:
```python
proxies = {
    'https': 'http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>',
}
response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies, headers=headers)
```

## Method 2: Using a SERP API

A SERP API, such as ScraperAPI, simplifies the scraping process by handling proxies, captchas, and data parsing for you.

### Advantages of SERP APIs
- **Ease of Use:** No need to build or maintain scraping logic.
- **Scalability:** Handles high volumes of requests effortlessly.
- **Accuracy:** Provides structured data directly.

### Example: Scraping Google Results with SERP API
```python
import requests
import json

def scrape_with_serp_api():
    payload = {
        'scraper': 'google_search',
        'q': 'car insurance',
        'domain': 'com',
        'geo': 'Germany',
        'parse': 'true',
    }

    for page in range(1, 3):  # Scraping 2 pages
        payload['page'] = page
        response = requests.post(
            url='https://rt.serpmaster.com/',
            auth=('username', 'password'),
            json=payload,
        )

        with open(f'results_page_{page}.json', 'w+') as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

This method eliminates the need for proxies, captchas, and manual data parsing, saving significant time and effort.
