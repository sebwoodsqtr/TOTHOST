# Everything You Need to Know About VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is a high-performance monitoring solution and time-series database, often used as a long-term remote storage option for Prometheus monitoring data. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore its features, use cases, and implementation strategies.

## The Need for High-Availability in Prometheus

Prometheus is widely used for monitoring with its powerful **PromQL** query language, integration with **Grafana**, and **Alertmanager** for alerting. However, in production environments, certain limitations arise:

- **Single Point of Failure**: A single Prometheus instance poses a risk.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Increased monitoring data size can affect performance and storage capacity.
- **Data Consistency**: Multiple Prometheus instances pulling data might lead to inconsistencies due to network delays or other issues.

For monitoring large-scale environments, a **high-availability** (HA) and **scalable Prometheus cluster** is critical. Letâ€™s explore how to achieve this.

## High Availability Strategies for Prometheus

### 1. Basic HA with Multiple Instances

Deploying multiple Prometheus instances to scrape the same metrics ensures availability. If one instance fails, traffic is routed to another. This setup reduces load but lacks **data consistency** and **persistence**.

### 2. Adding Remote Storage

Enhance data persistence by integrating remote storage. Even if a Prometheus instance fails, data recovery is possible via the remote storage backend.

### 3. Leader Election for Improved Efficiency

For better efficiency in large-scale setups, implement leader election. A **leader node** scrapes metrics, while other nodes act as backups. Kubernetesâ€™ **Lease object** can simplify this process.

### 4. Federated Clusters

When monitoring large environments, split metrics collection across multiple Prometheus instances. For instance, one instance collects **node metrics**, while another handles **application-level metrics**. A central Prometheus instance aggregates the data.

## Introducing VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is a **cost-effective**, **scalable**, and **highly available** solution for long-term storage of Prometheus data. It is also a **time-series database** with several advantages:

- Compatible with Prometheus API and usable as a **Grafana datasource**.
- Offers **high performance** for metrics ingestion and querying.
- Efficient **memory usage**: Uses 7x less memory compared to Prometheus and others.
- Advanced **data compression**, saving up to 70x the storage space compared to TimescaleDB.
- Optimized for **high-latency, low-IOPS storage**.
- Simplifies operations with a **single executable** and no external dependencies.

### Key Components of VictoriaMetrics

1. **vmstorage**: Handles data storage and retrieval.
2. **vminsert**: Manages data ingestion.
3. **vmselect**: Facilitates querying and aggregation.
4. **vmagent**: Scrapes metrics, serving as a replacement for Prometheus scraping.
5. **vmalert**: Manages alerting and recording rules.

## Single-Node Deployment of VictoriaMetrics

Deploying a single-node VictoriaMetrics instance is straightforward. It can run on Kubernetes or standalone environments. Hereâ€™s an example of deploying VictoriaMetrics with Node Exporter metrics:

1. **Deploy Prometheus**: Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Node Exporter.
2. **Add Remote Write**: Update Prometheus to write metrics to VictoriaMetrics.

```bash
kubectl apply -f vm-single.yaml
kubectl get svc victoria-metrics -n kube-vm
```

3. Update Grafanaâ€™s data source to use VictoriaMetrics.

## Scaling with VictoriaMetrics Cluster

For environments ingesting more than 1 million data points per second, consider using VictoriaMetrics in a **cluster mode**. A cluster consists of:

- **vmstorage**: Stores raw data.
- **vminsert**: Manages data ingestion.
- **vmselect**: Handles queries.

Scaling VictoriaMetrics involves adding more nodes to each component, ensuring seamless performance even during high traffic.

## Using `vmagent` for Metrics Collection

VictoriaMetricsâ€™ **vmagent** replaces Prometheus for scraping metrics, offering:

- Lower resource usage.
- Support for multiple data ingestion protocols (Prometheus, InfluxDB, etc.).
- Resilient remote write with temporary disk storage.

### Deploying `vmagent`

Configure `vmagent` with remote write settings pointing to **vminsert**.

```yaml
# Example vmagent configuration
-remoteWrite.url=http://vminsert:8480/insert/0/prometheus
-promscrape.config=/config/scrape.yml
```

## vmalert for Alerting

VictoriaMetrics includes **vmalert** to handle alerting rules and integrate with **Alertmanager**.

Key features:
- Supports Prometheus-style alert rules.
- Compatible with VictoriaMetricsâ€™ **MetricsQL**.
- Lightweight with no external dependencies.

## Simplifying Management with VictoriaMetrics Operator

The **VictoriaMetrics Operator** simplifies deployment and management of VictoriaMetrics. It supports:

- **VMSingle** for single-node setups.
- **VMCluster** for distributed deployments.
- Integration with existing Prometheus configurations.

Deploying a **VMCluster** object creates all required components automatically:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMCluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster-demo
spec:
  retentionPeriod: "1w"
  replicaCount: 2
```

## Conclusion

VictoriaMetrics is a powerful and efficient solution for monitoring large-scale environments. Its integration capabilities with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager make it a top choice for high-availability and scalable monitoring.
