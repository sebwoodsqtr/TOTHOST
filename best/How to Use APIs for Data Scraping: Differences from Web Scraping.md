# How to Use APIs for Data Scraping: Differences from Web Scraping

## Background

Many tech companies have vast user databases that are already well-organized and parsed by engineering teams. For example, analysts in larger B2C companies can often rely on internal tools like HSQL to access the data they need. However, smaller B2B companies may not have direct access to such extensive user data. Instead, they rely heavily on engineering teams to collect third-party data using APIs and web scraping to support product development and business growth.

For data analysts in these companies, itâ€™s crucial to understand how to call APIs and collect external data when existing internal databases donâ€™t have the required information.

## Introduction to APIs

API calls are often part of the web scraping process. There are two primary types of APIs used in this context:

### 1. Library APIs

Library APIs are interfaces provided by a library (e.g., Python libraries) that developers can use. Think of it like accessing a package in a lockerâ€”you need the correct credentials (API keys) to access the package (library functionalities).

### 2. Data APIs

Data APIs function as a connection between backend systems and the frontend, transmitting pre-organized data for use. Unlike web scraping, data APIs offer a more efficient and simpler way to extract data since the data is already structured. 

**Key Differences from Web Scraping:**
- APIs provide clean, structured data without requiring HTML parsing.
- Web scraping often adds server load and risks IP bans, especially if scraping patterns arenâ€™t human-like.
- Data APIs, while efficient, may impose strict rate limits or require paid access for larger scraping needs.

## The Simplicity of API-based Scraping

Below is an example of using the **Facebook Graph API** to demonstrate the typical API scraping process.

**Steps in API-based Scraping:**
1. **Access API Documentation:** API documentation provides details on how to structure requests and retrieve data.
2. **Request Data:** Use HTTP requests, often through Python's `requests` library.
3. **Set Request Parameters:** Define the parameters to fetch specific data. For example, with the Facebook Graph API, you can request fields like `created_time` (post date) and `post_id` (post ID).

### Facebook Graph API Example

To use Facebook's API, a token is required to authenticate your requests. Hereâ€™s a quick illustration:

#### Unauthorized Request Example
```python
import requests

r = requests.get('https://facebook.com/user_id')
print(r.json())
```

**Error Message:**
```json
{
  "documentation_url": "https://facebook.com/user_id/#get-the-access-token",
  "message": "Requires authentication"
}
```

#### Gaining Access
To fetch posts, youâ€™ll need an **access token**. Facebook provides clear documentation on how to retrieve tokens, and many tutorials (like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hF099c0A9M)) guide you through the process.

#### Example: Using an Access Token
Once authenticated, the same API request will return the desired JSON response:

## Use Case: Analyzing Facebook Video Posts

### Objective
Analyze a userâ€™s video post performance (e.g., views by country, gender, and age) between March 1 and March 7, 2020.

### Steps
1. Retrieve post IDs for the specified date range.
2. Filter for video posts only.
3. Extract data on views by demographics and watch time.
4. Organize JSON data into a dataframe.
5. Visualize the watch time distribution.

### Sample Process
```python
# Example workflow
1. Fetch all posts between March 1 and March 7.
2. Filter for posts that are videos.
3. Query API for demographic watch-time statistics.
4. Convert JSON response into a pandas dataframe.
5. Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for analysis.
```

### Final Thoughts

API-based scraping simplifies data collection and ensures clean, structured output. While APIs eliminate much of the complexity of traditional web scraping, they often come with usage limits or require payments for large-scale operations. Tools like ScraperAPI can further streamline your scraping workflows by automating proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving, and more.

Happy scraping!
