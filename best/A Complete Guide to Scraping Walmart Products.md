## Getting Started with Walmart Scraping

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to scrape and extract product data for Walmart's "Coffee" category using Python and ScraperAPI. Here's the data we aim to collect:
- **Product ID**
- **Title**
- **Thumbnail**
- **Rating**
- **Reviews**
- **Seller Name**
- **Price**

To get started, install the necessary library:

```bash
pip install google-search-results
```

### Example Python Code

```python
from serpapi import GoogleSearch
import os, json

params = {
    'api_key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',         # Replace with your ScraperAPI key
    'engine': 'walmart',               # Walmart search engine
    'query': 'Coffee'                  # Search query
}

results = GoogleSearch(params).get_dict()['organic_results']
```

### Exporting Data to CSV

Once you retrieve the product data, you can save it to a CSV file for further analysis:

```python
import csv

header = ['product_id', 'title', 'thumbnail', 'rating', 'reviews', 'seller_name', 'price']

with open('walmart_products.csv', 'w', encoding='UTF8', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)

    writer.writerow(header)

    for item in results:
        writer.writerow([
            item.get('product_id'),
            item.get('title'),
            item.get('thumbnail'),
            item.get('rating'),
            item.get('reviews'),
            item.get('seller_name'),
            item.get('primary_offer', {}).get('offer_price')
        ])
```

This Python example demonstrates how to extract Walmart product data efficiently. You can adapt this script to your preferred programming language, such as Ruby, Node.js, Java, or PHP.
