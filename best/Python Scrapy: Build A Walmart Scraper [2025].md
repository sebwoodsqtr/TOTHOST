# Python Scrapy: Build A Walmart Scraper [2025]

![Python Scrapy: Build A Walmart Scraper](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyaskan9k/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://assets-scrapeops.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Images/Playbooks/Scrapy-Playbook/scrapy-walmart.jpg)

In this guide, part of our **"How To Scrape X With Python Scrapy"** series, weâ€™ll walk you through building a Python Scrapy spider to scrape product data from [Walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com/).

Walmart is one of the most popular e-commerce websites for web scrapers, with billions of product pages scraped monthly.

## Architecting Our Walmart Scraper

Before we dive into coding, let's outline the scraping architecture. The design depends on:

- **The use case:** Why are we scraping Walmart?  
- **Data requirements:** What data do we need to extract?  
- **Frequency:** How often will the scraper run?  
- **Scale:** How much data is required?  
- **Technical skill level:** How complex can the system be?

For this example, weâ€™ll assume the following:

- **Objective:** Monitor product rankings for specific keywords and gather daily product data.  
- **Required Data:** Product rankings, pricing, reviews, and other essential product details.  
- **Scale:** A small-scale project, focusing on a few keywords.  
- **Data Storage:** Store data in a CSV file for simplicity, with examples for MySQL and Postgres databases.

Our Scrapy spider will combine a **product discovery crawler** and a **product data scraper**. The spider will crawl Walmartâ€™s search pages, extract product URLs, and scrape individual product details. Data will be saved using [Scrapy Feed Exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html).

## Building a Walmart Product Crawler

The first step is creating a Scrapy spider that generates a list of product URLs for scraping.

### Step 1: Understanding Walmartâ€™s Search Pages

Walmartâ€™s search pages return **up to 40 products** per page. For example, the URL for searching "iPads" is:

```
https://www.walmart.com/search?q=ipad
```

**Key URL parameters:**
- `q`: The search query (e.g., `q=ipad`). Ensure keywords with spaces or special characters are properly encoded.  
- `sort`: Sorting order (`best_seller`, `price_low`, `price_high`, etc.).  
- `page`: The page number (e.g., `page=1`).

**Limitations:**
- Walmart displays a maximum of **25 pages** per search query. To get more results:
  1. Use more specific queries (e.g., "iPhone 13", "iPhone 14").
  2. Combine different sorting parameters (`price_low`, `price_high`, etc.).

**Extracting Data:**
The product data is embedded as **JSON** within the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` tag. Extracting and parsing this JSON allows easy access to product details.

### Step 2: Building the Walmart Search Crawler

Our crawler will paginate through search results for a list of keywords. It will send requests to Walmartâ€™s search pages, extract product URLs, and queue them for further scraping.

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation of the crawler:

```python
import scrapy

class WalmartSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'walmart'
    start_urls = ['https://www.walmart.com/search?q=ipad']

    def parse(self, response):
        # Extract JSON data from Walmart search pages
        json_data = response.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
        # Parse product URLs and iterate through pages
        # (Logic for extracting URLs and pagination goes here)
```

---

## Scraping Walmart Product Pages

Once we have the list of product URLs, the next step is to scrape detailed product information, such as pricing, reviews, and descriptions.

### Step 1: Adding a Product Scraper Callback

Update the crawler to pass each product URL to a `parse_product_data()` method. This method will extract the required product data.

### Step 2: Understanding Walmart Product Pages

Example Walmart product page URL:  
```
https://www.walmart.com/ip/123456
```

Walmart product pages also use JSON embedded in `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">`. This eliminates the need for complex CSS or XPath selectors.

---

### Step 3: Building the Product Scraper

Hereâ€™s an example of a Scrapy spider that extracts product data:

```python
def parse_product_data(self, response):
    # Extract JSON from product page
    json_data = response.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
    product_data = json.loads(json_data)
    # Extract and save required fields
```

## Anti-Bot Protection and Bypassing CAPTCHAs

Walmart implements **anti-bot protection**, including CAPTCHAs and IP bans. To scrape Walmart reliably, youâ€™ll need to:

- Rotate proxies and user-agents.  
- Use headless browsers for JavaScript rendering.  

### The Easy Solution: ScraperAPI

ScraperAPI automatically handles:
- Proxy rotation.  
- User-agent rotation.  
- CAPTCHA bypassing.  
- Country IP targeting.  

Integrating ScraperAPI into your Scrapy project is simple. Install the ScraperAPI middleware, and route requests through their API.
